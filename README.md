RTC Roulette
============

WebRTC Chat Roulette is brought to you by the creators of Twelephone (htp://twelephone.com).  It's written in Node.JS and uses web sockets to manage presence and Phono (http://phono.com) to manage the WebRTC signaling and call setup.

This project was developed by @ChrisMatthieu at the NodeConf 2013 hackathon.  The concept was to build something similar to Chat Roulette but using modern HTML5 and WebRTC technology.  Please feel free to send us feedback and pull requests!
